Title: HealthFi Vault — Decentralized Preventive Healthcare Savings on BDAG
Abstract
HealthFi Vault is a decentralized finance protocol built on BDAG that enables users to save and grow funds specifically for healthcare needs. By combining smart yield vaults, health milestone verification, and community governance, HealthFi Vault bridges the gap between financial empowerment and preventive healthcare.
Problem Statement
Preventive healthcare is often neglected due to financial constraints. Traditional financial systems do not incentivize healthy behavior or provide flexible, goal-based savings mechanisms for medical needs.
Solution
HealthFi Vault introduces health-tagged smart vaults that generate yield through DeFi strategies. Users can unlock funds or borrow against their vaults when verified health milestones are met. The protocol is governed by a DAO and powered by BDAG tokens.
